      <summary>Education Background</summary>
    <p>I've stayed within the same district starting from Preschool, all the way until receiving my High School Diploma; even so, I moved around a lot, from neighbouring city to neighbouring city in the local area.</p>
      </details>
    <ul>
      <li>Ramona Preschool</li>
      <li>Glazier Elementary</li>
      <li>Los Alisos Middle School</li>
      <li>Norwalk High School</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When committing to CSU Fullerton in 2020, at the peak of the Coronavirus Pandemic, I was initially accepted into the Computer Engineering department, before eventually switching my major and beginning my path in Computer Science. With a willingness to learn from the earliest age I can remember, some of my interests with respect to areas of studies included:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Computer Engineering</li>
      <li>Aerospace Engineering(which is unfortunately not offered at our school)</li>
      <li>Computer Science</li>
      <li>Mechanical Engineering</li>
    </ol>

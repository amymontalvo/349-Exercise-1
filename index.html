    <br>
    <p>Although I have not always had a Computer Science background from the beginnings of my educational career, I have taken an interest in the subject after taking my first Web Design class in my last year of high school. </p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm interested in learning about a wide range of fields, from web development to artifical inteligence and I hope to, in the future, pursue an Aerospace Engineering degree. Aside from my continued interest in everything Computer Science has to offer, I like to work with the Digital Marketing side of things (email marketing, in particular) and use my knowledge of front-end programming languages to make certain emails more effective.</p>
